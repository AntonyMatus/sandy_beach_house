                                As many as 1.5 million U.S. and Canadian citizens already call Mexico home, with more joining them all the time. Thanks to Mexico’s large size, varied geography, and affordable real estate, prospective residents are spoiled for choice among silver-mining towns, fishing villages, beach retreats, and cosmopolitan cities.

                                “International Living frequently hear myths about buying Mexican Real Estate,” says International Living Executive Editor, Jennifer Stevens. “It’s a shame because people’s misperceptions create a wholly inaccurate picture of what’s going on there. In truth, Mexico offers great weather, beautiful scenery, and authentic Latin American culture—plus good- value real estate options for North Americans looking to retire on a modest budget. And just to be clear: It’s absolutely possible—and legal—to own property in Mexico.
                            </p>

                                However, when it comes to buying Mexican real estate, the truth doesn’t always prevail. To break it down in plain English: If you’re not Mexican, the title to property within the restricted zones must be held within a bank trust or a Mexican corporation—not directly. But understand: That trust is easily transferable when an owner is ready to sell. This is a safe, legal, and extremely common vehicle for foreign ownership in Mexico. And, again, this restriction only applies close to shorelines and international borders. Outside the restricted zones, foreigners can own directly as an individual.

                                    Whats the purpose of a Fideicomiso? <br>
                                    It allows foreigners the right to buy real estate in Mexico within the “restricted” zone. And to ensure a secure transaction. What’s the restricted zone in Mexico? The “restricted” zone is any land 31 miles (or 50 km) from the coast and 62 miles (100 km) from the border. <br>
                                    Why did Mexico create the Fideicomiso? <br>
                                    When the Mexicans wrote the Mexico Constitution they wrote it to protect the land Mexico. As great loss of land had occurred throughout Mexico’s history. Instead of amending the Mexican constitution, they created and added the fideicomiso. This promotes a high demand from international investments, often on the coast. <br>
                                    What about buying outside of the restricted zone? <br>
                                    Do I need a Fideicomiso? <br>
                                    Foreigners can buy residential properties outside the restricted zone without a fiduciary. Yet often buyers buy their property outside the restricted with a Fideicomiso anyway. what is a fideicomiso in english The Bank of Mexico. <br>

                                    Your fiduciary is not owned by the bank; they are only administrators. You and your kin are the beneficiaries. The fideicomiso of your Mexican property is granted to you. You are the beneficiary and it is not considered property of the bank. <br>
                                    Can the Mexican Government take my property? <br>
                                    Foreigners need not worry that their property be taken by the Mexican government. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mexico can not, directly or indirectly, expropriate. There is only one exception. When the government needs the land for public works (example: road construction). <br>
                                    Only through legal condemnation is this possible. In the rare case that it is necessary to expropriate land, the government will pay the current price with interest to the owner of the land. This is known as Eminent Domain in the US, Compulsory Purchase in the UK or Expropriation in Canada. <br>
                                    How can the Mexican Government take foreigner’s land? <br>
                                    Have you heard stories of people buying property and the Mexican Government re-taken it? <br>
                                    This can only happen if the unfortunate person bought Ejidatario land. This is land without title. Only Mexican citizens can buy Ejido land.
